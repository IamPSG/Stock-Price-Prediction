**What is the Stock Market?**
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
Such financial activities are conducted through institutionalized formal exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces which operate under a defined set of regulations. 
There can be multiple stock trading venues in a country or a region which allow transactions in stocks and other forms of securities.

**Understanding the Problem Statement**
We’ll dive into the implementation part of this article soon, but first it’s important to establish what we’re aiming to solve. Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.

Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
As you might have guessed, our focus will be on the technical analysis part. We’ll be using the dataset of Microsoft stock prices from April 2015 to April 2021 to build a model capable of estimating the stock prices. Time to dive in!
